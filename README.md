# github-portfolio Fullstack

Wilfran Jordhoy

Hi! I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented fullstack developer with solid experience in modern web technologies. I build scalable, user-friendly, and robust solutions with a strong focus on clean code and best development practices. Below is an overview of my tech stack and how I apply it in practice.

🌐 Frontend
🔹 HTML & CSS
What: The foundation of structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) for all web pages.
Relevance: Essential for any web developer—everything else builds on this.
Example: Used in every project to ensure semantic and accessible markup.

🔹 Tailwind CSS
What: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and responsive UI development.
Relevance: Speeds up development and ensures consistent design.
Example: Used to quickly prototype and design UI directly within HTML.

🔹 JavaScript & TypeScript
What: JavaScript is the core of frontend logic. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JS.
Relevance: TypeScript provides safer and more maintainable code.
Example: Used for component logic, API calls, and data handling in React applications.

🔹 React & Next.js
What: React is a UI library, and Next.js is a fullstack framework built on top of React.
Relevance: Next.js provides SSR, SSG, dynamic routes, and API routes—all in one place.
Example: Used to build everything from landing pages to advanced dashboards with React + Next.js.

⚙️ Backend
🔹 Node.js & Express
What: Node.js runs JavaScript on the server. Express is a minimalist backend framework.
Relevance: Enables fast development of RESTful APIs.
Example: Built backends for CRUD applications with authentication, validation, and database integration.

🔹 Prisma
What: A type-safe ORM for working with databases in Node.js.
Relevance: Ensures safe database access with automatic type safety in TypeScript.
Example: Used to model and connect PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

🔹 SQL
What: Structured Query Language – the standard for databases.
Relevance: Fundamental for understanding data modeling and queries.
Example: Used directly or through Prisma to perform complex queries.

🔄 APIs & Testing
🔹 REST APIs
What: The standard for communication between frontend and backend.
Relevance: All modern applications rely on APIs for data exchange.
Example: Built REST APIs with Express and Next.js API routes.

🔹 JSON
What: Lightweight data format used in nearly all APIs.
Relevance: Understanding JSON is essential for API integration.
Example: Used for sending and receiving data between frontend and backend.

🔹 Postman
What: A tool for testing and documenting APIs.
Relevance: Invaluable during development and debugging.
Example: Used to test all endpoints in CRUD operations.

⚒️ Development Tools
🔹 Git & GitHub
What: Version control system and collaboration platform.
Relevance: Critical for teamwork, history tracking, and deployment workflows.
Example: Used in all projects with branching strategies and CI/CD pipelines.

🔹 Terminal (CLI)
What: Interface for direct interaction with the system.
Relevance: Streamlines development and offers full control over builds, installations, and deployments.
Example: Used for npm scripts, git commands, environment setup, etc.

🔹 Excalidraw
What: A tool for creating simple diagrams and sketches.
Relevance: Great for planning architecture and visually communicating ideas.
Example: Used to create flowcharts for system architecture and data models.

📁 Project Structure & Workflow
Every project I work on follows a structured approach:

1. Planning & Design
Sketches and diagrams in Excalidraw

Database modeling (with Prisma or SQL)

2. Development
Frontend with React/Next.js + Tailwind

Backend with Express/Node.js

API design and testing using Postman

3. Version Control & Collaboration
GitHub repositories with issues, pull requests, and branching

4. Testing & Quality
API testing with Postman

Error handling and logging via terminal

5. Deployment
Deploy via Vercel, Render, or Railway

🎯 Why This Stack Is Powerful
✅ I cover the entire stack – from UI to database.
✅ I use modern tools that streamline development and increase code quality.
✅ I work type-safe with TypeScript and Prisma.
✅ I test and document APIs like a pro.
✅ I collaborate efficiently through GitHub and CLI.
